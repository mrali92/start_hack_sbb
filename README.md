# About The Project
In the near future, we plan to make our model even more accurate by integrating hardware sensors that detect whether a parking spot is currently used. We purposely did not ask the users for occupancy in order to keep the UX design user-friendly. We simply believe that our model is powerful enough to make customer feedback about the current occupancy rate obsolete.

Our approach uses a predictive model to forecast the density of occupied parking space and also to estimate the frequency rate of the Ongoing and outgoing  cars per hours for a specific parking lot. Moreover, we categorize the dataset in 4 main Level, that depends on the diversity and complexity of the datasets
## Getting Started
### jupyter notebook '''data_analysis.ipynb'''
main file that summarizes 3 steps :
1. Data exploring
2. Data preprocessing, cleaning and Features extraction
3. Predictive model design (unfortunately we didnt mange to finalize it )
### Folder  '''database_rest_api''' 
* unfinished rest api for web application (not working)
### Folder  '''Bokeh_Python_Visualization''' 
* Visualization web interface for the SBB dataset (unfortunately we didnt get time to finalize it ) 
### Folder '''Data'''
Contains all the used and downloaded data from the SBB databank and other sources
